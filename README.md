# Winkie

An email client for iOS built with Swift 3. This was our group's project for the Hackatruck course, where we studied iOS development and how to use tools available on IBM Cloud, i.e. Watson, NODE-Red and Cloudant.

NOTICE: this is a prototype, it does not connect to an actual email account, instead it simulates an email account using JSONs from a Cloudant Databse

This app uses the following frameworks:

- [AlamoFire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
- [JTAppleCalendar](https://github.com/patchthecode/JTAppleCalendar)
- [IQKeyboardManager](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager)
